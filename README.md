Trial of replicating Google's homepage, in the context of The Odin Project's.
First project of the curriculum.

This is being written in August, 2, 2021.

I don't know yet how much time I'll be able to commit for this project, or even for programming. Neither if I will keep going.

If I go through this successfully, I'll get basic understanding of HTML and CSS.
